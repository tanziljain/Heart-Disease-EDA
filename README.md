# Heart-Disease-EDA
# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project performs data analysis and visualization on a heart disease dataset to understand the key features affecting heart health. It serves as an exploratory data science project with the goal of identifying insights that could help in early heart disease detection.

---

## 📌 Objective

To explore the heart disease dataset and uncover significant patterns using:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature understanding for possible future ML modeling

---

## 📁 Files

- `Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `heart.csv` – Dataset used for the project (loaded from `/kaggle/input/heart-failure-prediction/heart.csv`).

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- OS (for directory listing)

---

## 🧠 Key Features Analyzed

- Age distribution and its relation to disease
- Chest pain types and frequency
- Resting blood pressure and cholesterol patterns
- Sex-based differences in prediction features
- Correlation heatmap between attributes

---

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps for correlation
- Histograms and barplots for key attributes
- Pairplots to observe clusters and separability

---

## 🔍 Insights Gained

- Certain features like `cp` (chest pain type), `thalachh` (maximum heart rate), and `oldpeak` are highly influential.
- Gender plays a noticeable role in observed risk patterns.
- Visual EDA can help guide feature selection for ML modeling.
